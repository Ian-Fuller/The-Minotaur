Overview:
- Player spawns in a randomly-generated maze
- New mazes can be entered/exited through doors around the edges of the maze
- Mazes may have rooms in them with treasure and traps
- Enemies spawn at random
- The player is constantly pursued by a powerful enemy, the Minotaur.
- The ultimate goal of the game is to try to survive and become powerful enough to defeat the Minotaur
- I will make this look better later
